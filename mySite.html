      <p><em>Computer Science Student & Web Enthusiast!</em></p>
      <p>My name is Ahnaf, and welcome to my website! I am an international student studying for my Bachelorâ€™s degree at the University of Alberta. I am
  studying computer science, and I am proficient with the languages C++, Python, and Java. I have over two years of
  experience coding in these languages. On the side, I have learned about mobile development, and some web design using
  Javascript.</p>
      <p>My first experience of working as a team was in my third year, during my Intro to Software Engineering course, where we
  had to organize ourselves, and create an <a href="appDev.html">app</a> using Android Studio that could communicate with our Firebase Database,
  could handle offline instructions in case of a connection failure, work smoothly, and have our own flair. We were a team of
  five undergrad students and since I was the leader, I found it useful to distribute our work using scrum practices and to
  work in sprints.</p>
